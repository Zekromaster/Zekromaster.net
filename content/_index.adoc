My name is Luca Cristiano, known online as Zekromaster (and as Zekromaster42 in
places where someone else is already known as Zekromaster).

I'm an italian developer, Free Software activist, and university student in 
Software Engineering.

This is the fifth time I build my own personal website, hoping it's also the 
last.

For why this website looks like it came straight from Tim Berners Lee's IBM 
Terminal: link:blog/why_this_site_sucks[see here].
